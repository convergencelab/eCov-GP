Version:    0.13


Change Log:
    0.1 (May 19, 2020): 
        - Initial version.
    
    0.2 (May 22, 2020):
        - Remove the end visualization.
        - Save final results to pickled file.
        - Visualization and results interpretation will occur in separate script. 

    0.3 (May 28, 2020):
        - 'evaluate_individual' returns the iterations list generated by ndlib's 'iterate'
        - Create and return an iterations like thing for mitigations (it will be some weird dictionary)
        - Use the trends function from nblib to convert the iterations list into something usable
        - Create a trends like function to convert the iterations like thing for mitigations into something usable for the fitness values

    0.4 (May 30, 2020):
        - Add a boolean flag to allow unused mitigations to be used at next evaluation period

    0.5 (June 3, 2020):
        - Evaluate Individual can take a chromosome that needs to be compiled, or an individual function. 

    0.6 (June 8, 2020):
        - Evaluate Individual takes a function
        - Evaluate population now passes a compiled function to evaluate individual

    0.7 (June 8, 2020):
        - Split files into sub-files of logical units
        - Files will be imported 

    0.8 (June 17, 2020):
        - Small changes to system to allow for new measure (average degree)

    0.9 (June 19, 2020):
        - Added more values to optimize (max infected, total infected)

    0.10 (July 22, 2020):
        - Updated alpha to reflect the latent period, NOT a probability

    0.11 (July 29, 2020):
        - Turn eleitism back on since we are recalculating everyone's fitness anyways

    0.12 (August 17, 2020):
        - Incorporating shortest dist stuff (new graph measure)

    0.13 (September 1, 2020):
        - Remove the casting as a dict

End Change Log



A GP search for effective vaccination strategies for a given graph

This version is relatively simple:
- Will be single objective. 
    - Will probably eventually want to make multi
        - Min tree size
        - Min max infected
        - Integral under infected curve
        - Total infected over period
        - Min mitigation used
- SEIR model (no E', where E' is exposed AND infected, but not detected)
- No fancy node info (age, pre existing conditions, etc.)
- Simple graph statistics 
    - Static
        - Travelers (CURRENT VERSION HAS A VERY HACK-IE IMPLEMENTATION)
    - Whole Graph
        - Number of certain status
        - Number of mitigations used
        - Is mitigation available? (boolean)
        - ***** (REMOVED FOR THIS VERSION DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS) Average distance between nodes of a given status
    - Single/Local Measures
        - Current Status
        - Node Degree
        - Average degree of neighbours
        - is traveler? (boolean)
        - Get number of neighbours of certain status

- Atomic Heuristics
    - For Susceptible & Exposed
        - Mitigate Self
    - For Infected
        - Mitigate Neighbours (ring vaccination)
    - MIGHT only work on susceptible/exposed (no looking at ring vaccination yet) 

I think to start the trees will simply be a boolean expression. If true, vac, otherwise, no.
